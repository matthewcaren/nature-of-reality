# On the Nature of Reality
On The Nature of Reality is a panic attack in multichannel audio.

Built upon an alternate tuning scheme where an octave is tuned to sqrt 2 rather than 2, every interval becomes dissonant, highlighting the point at which the harmonious laws of our world shift, bending and disintigrating into something more sinister.

Written in SuperCollider.
